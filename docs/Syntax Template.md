# COMP280 Security Assignment
You should document the issues you find in this markdown document. If you get stuck using markdown you can
upload a document in a different format (ie, PDF) to this folder with the name 'security.pdf'.

For each problem you find:

* **Describe** the problem and what security impact it has
* **Identify** a problem type, with reference to a suitable source
* **Identify and justify** a rating
* **Provide** a proof of concept, detailing how the problem can be *exploited*
* **Explain** how the issue can be resolved (potentially with commit/code fixes)

**tip** to hit the 'advocate' learning outcome, you should make reference organisations and suitable sources within the security field, and show how they are relevent.

In some (most) cases, these issues will be a little contrived and would have little/no impact in the 'real world'. That's fine in this case - many of the problems classes I've introduced could have more serious impacts in 'real-world' applications/games. I'm not expecting you to be able to exploit some of the more advanced issues in this project - identifying and fixing them is enouph.

I'm also expecting that many of you only have a surface-level understanding of C++. That shouldn't be an issue to find many/most of the issues.
